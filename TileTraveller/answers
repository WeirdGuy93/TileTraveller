    Longer code is always harder to read, it's easy to read
    but unnecessarily long.

    If we make a function for each step we're dividing it into "chapters",
    making the main program much easier to read and each step is more
    straight forward.
    The functions make the code inside them easier to read because they
    only have one objective.
